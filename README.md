# Git and GitHub Practice Repository

Welcome to my Git and GitHub practice repository! This repository represents my journey of learning and practicing Git and GitHub. Throughout this work, I have gained knowledge and experience in various areas:

## Key Learnings

- Working with remote and local repositories: I have become proficient in initializing and connecting to remote repositories, as well as setting up and managing local repositories.
- Full Git flow: I have successfully completed the full Git flow, understanding the standard workflow for collaborative development.
- Branch operations: I have performed various branch-related actions, including creating, switching, renaming, deleting, and merging branches. These actions have enabled efficient collaboration and code management.
- Pull Requests (PRs): I have practiced creating and reviewing pull requests, a vital aspect of collaborative Git workflows.
- Git push and git pull: I have utilized `git push` and `git pull` to upload and retrieve changes between my local and remote repositories.

## Bug Reports and Test Cases

In this repository, you will find examples of bug reports and test cases that I have created. These serve as demonstrations of my understanding and application of quality assurance principles.

## Postman Collections

I have also included two Postman collections in this repository. These collections have been developed to enhance my skills in API testing. Here are the details of the collections:

- Tool Rental API: Explore the [documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/quick-introduction-to-postman/blob/main/simple-tool-rental-api.md) for the Tool Rental API, which provides information on how to interact with the API endpoints for tool rentals.
- Trello: The [Trello API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-boards/#api-boards-id-memberships-get) will guide you in understanding the available endpoints and functionalities for integrating Trello with other applications.

Feel free to explore the bug reports, test cases, and Postman collections. I hope you find them helpful and informative.
